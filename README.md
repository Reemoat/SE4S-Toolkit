### Goal Model Usage

The user must highlight an option in the palette and then use that palette
option's functionality on the canvas.

The goal model conforms to [GRL](www.cs.toronto.edu/km/GRL). You can find an
example goal model in the documentation folder.

###### Select

This option lets the user drag and resize the elements on the model's canvas.

###### Comment

The user may leave comments anywhere on the canvas.

###### Links

The user may connect the elements together using these options. To connect,
click one of the desired shapes and then click the other one.

###### Elements 

The user may place these shapes on the canvas. The user may edit an element's
text by clicking it.

###### Exporting

The user may export the goal model to XML, PNG, or PDF.
